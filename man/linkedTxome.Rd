\arguments{
\item{indexDir}{the local path to the Salmon index}

\item{source}{the source of transcriptome (e.g. "de-novo").
Note: if you specify "GENCODE" or "Ensembl", this will trigger
behavior by tximeta that may not be desired: e.g. attempts to
download canonical transcriptome data from AnnotationHub
(unless useHub=FALSE when running tximeta) and parsing of
Ensembl GTF using ensembldb (which may fail if the GTF file
has been modified). For transcriptomes that are defined by
local GTF files, it is recommended to use the terms "LocalGENCODE"
or "LocalEnsembl"}

\item{organism}{organism (e.g. "Homo sapiens")}

\item{release}{release number (e.g. "27")}

\item{genome}{genome (e.g. "GRCh38", or "none")}

\item{fasta}{location(s) for the FASTA transcript sequences
(of which the transcripts used to build the index is equal or a subset).
This can be a local path, or an HTTP or FTP URL}

\item{gtf}{location for the GTF/GFF file
(of which the transcripts used to build the index is equal or a subset).
This can be a local path, or an HTTP or FTP URL
While the \code{fasta} argument can take a vector of length greater than one
(more than one FASTA file containing transcripts used in indexing),
the \code{gtf} argument has to be a single GTF/GFF file. If transcripts
were added to a standard set of reference transcripts (e.g. fusion genes,
or pathogen transcripts), it is recommended that the tximeta user would manually
add these to the GTF/GFF file, and post the modified GTF/GFF publicly, such as
on Zenodo. This enables consistent annotation and downstream annotation
tasks, such as by \code{summarizeToGene}.}

\item{write}{logical, should a JSON file be written out
which documents the transcriptome checksum and metadata? (default is TRUE)}

\item{jsonFile}{the path to the json file for the linkedTxome}
}
\value{
nothing, the function is run for its side effects
}
\description{
\code{makeLinkedTxome} reads the checksum associated with a Salmon
index at \code{indexDir}, and links it to key information
about the transcriptome, including the \code{source}, \code{organism},
\code{release}, and \code{genome} (these are custom character strings),
as well as the locations (e.g. local, HTTP, or FTP) for one or more \code{fasta}
files and one \code{gtf} file. \code{loadLinkedTxome} loads this
information from a JSON file. See Details.
}
\details{
\code{makeLinkedTxome} links the information about the transcriptome
used for quantification in two ways:
1) the function will store a record in tximeta's cache such that
future import of quantification data will automatically access and
parse the GTF as if the transcriptome were one of those automatically
detected by tximeta. Then all features of tximeta (e.g. summarization
to gene, programmatic adding of IDs or metadata) will be available;
2) it will by default write out a JSON file
that can be shared, or posted online, and which can be read by
\code{loadLinkedTxome} which will store the information in tximeta's
cache. This should make the full quantification-import pipeline
computationally reproducible / auditable even for transcriptomes
which differ from those provided by references (GENCODE, Ensembl,
RefSeq).

For further details please see the "Linked transcriptomes"
section of the tximeta vignette.
